# Dungeon Crawler

I coded this and the Rust program found in the [dungeoncrawlecs](https://github.com/jdjaustin/dungeoncrawlecs) repository by following along in [Hands-on Rust](https://pragprog.com/titles/hwrust/hands-on-rust/) by Herbert Wolverson.

It's a simple dungeon crawler game that uses the up, down, left, and right arrows to move around a character. Game art was sourced from: [Buch](https://opengameart.org/content/unfinished-dungeon-tileset); [Melissa Krautheim](https://opengameart.org/content/fantasy-magic-set); and [Dungeon Crawl Stone Coup](https://github.com/crawl/tiles) under CC Zero license.

I chose to do this project because--while I have some experience coding in a major game engine like Unity--I wanted to learn how to build a game from the ground up in Rust. By implementing this simple project, I learned more about using crates and modules, organizing imports with a prelude, using "programmer art" as a placeholder for some of the finer artwork linked above, rendering player, camera, and map elements, and connecting the player and camera.
